The Online Northwest annual conference attracts information professionals whose job involves keeping up with new concepts, technologies, and products for academic, public and corporate libraries. Conference registration draws primarily from Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, and northern California. 

Exhibitors and sponsors are an important part of our conference, and we encourage you to participate!
