<p><a target="_blank" href="http://andromedayelton.com/talks/onw14/">Referenced articles and photo credits from Andromeda's presentation</a></p><h2><span>Presentations</span></h2><p><a href="http://onlinenorthwest.org/about/blog/2014/3/4/digital-badges-in-libraries-skills-based-instruction-code-shifting-and-collaboration"><strong>Digital Badges in Libraries: Skill-based Instruction, Code-shifting, and Collaboration</strong></a><br /><em>Emily Ford, Urban &amp; Public Affairs Librarian, Portland State University<br />Nicholas Schiller, Systems &amp; Instruction Librarian, Washington State University- Vancouver<br />Dawn Richardson, Assistant Professor of Community Health, Portland State University</em><br />Digital badges present librarians with new ways of engaging with patrons including recognizing patron achievement and improved communication. This session will provide an overview of digital badges--including an explanation of underlying pedagogical aims--and will address badging as “code-shifting” or using different communication methods for different audiences. Finally, it will present a major collaboration between Portland State University Library and disciplinary faculty to integrate badges in undergraduate courses, providing librarian and disciplinary faculty perspectives.</p><p><a href="http://onlinenorthwest.org/about/blog/2014/3/3/strange-new-world-linked-data-for-catalogers-and-metadata-librarians"><strong>Strange New World: Linked Data for Catalogers and Metadata Librarians</strong></a><br /><em>Jessica Hayden, Technical Services Manager, University of Northern Colorado</em><br />Linked data has been hailed as a disruptive innovation that will change the way we organize and discover information, but what does it really mean for catalogers and metadata creators? This presentation will cover the background of linked data and demonstrate developments that take advantage of it. It will highlight projects of particular interest to librarians including the Library of Congress Bibliographic Framework Initiative. A portion of the session will be devoted to using linked data sources such as VIAF and the Open Metadata Registry to create a bibliographic record in BibFrame. The presentation will include discussion of current systems limitations and ways to utilize linked data outside our current ILS. Librarians will walk away with an understanding of how linked data will affect their work in the future, and they will learn about tools to begin utilizing linked data now to expose some of their collections.</p><p><a href="http://onlinenorthwest.org/about/blog/2014/3/6/nuanced-and-timely-capturing-collections-feedback-at-point-of-use"><strong>Nuanced and Timely: Capturing Collections Feedback at Point of Use</strong></a><br /><em>Richard A. Stoddart, Assessment Librarian, Oregon State University Libraries &amp; Press<br />Jane Nichols, Collection Development Librarian, Oregon State University Libraries &amp; Press (</em><a href="https://twitter.com/janienickel">@janienickel</a>)<br /><em>Terry Reese, Head, Digital Initiatives, The Ohio State University</em><br />While libraries use sophisticated metrics to determine e-resources usefulness, impact and cost effectiveness, much of this reflects past usage. To elicit qualitative data, an open-source application that inserts a pop-up survey between a citation and its full-text was tested. Inspired by MINES for Libraries®, this pop-up survey aims to capture users’ real-time reasons for selecting a given resource. Join us to learn about the application, users responses to the survey and to discuss future uses.</p><p><a href="http://onlinenorthwest.org/about/blog/2014/3/3/harnessing-the-web-to-create-an-environment-for-curiosity-exploration-and-learning"><strong>Harnessing the Web to Create an Environment that Supports Curiosity, Exploration and Learning</strong></a><br /><em>Anne-Marie Deitering, Franklin A. McEdward Professor for Undergraduate Learning Initiatives, Oregon State University Libraries<br />Hannah Gascho Rempel, Science Librarian &amp; Graduate Student Services Coordinator, Oregon State University Libraries<br />Chad Iwertz, English Graduate Student &amp; Writing Intensive Curriculum Intern, Oregon State University</em><br />How curious are you? Probably exceptionally curious today! But have you thought about how curiosity affects your approach to research? We know choosing a topic is one of the hardest parts of the research process for students, but we don't have as much experience helping students navigate this stage as we do helping them find and cite sources. During this session we will all assess our curiosity dispositions and discuss how to use that information to think about research topics. We'll examine a variety of online tools and talk about how to use them with students during topic selection.</p><p><a href="http://onlinenorthwest.org/about/blog/2014/3/6/open-badges-open-doors"><strong>Open Badges Open Doors</strong></a><br /><em>Meggie Wright, Oregon State University<br />Nate Otto, Indiana University</em><br />The Mozilla Foundation’s Open Badges are a new technology that makes it possible for anyone to issue, earn, and display proof of an educational achievement. Open Badges are digital tokens, like merit badges you might receive in the real world. They can be displayed on websites, job sites, and social media. Badges can be used to tell a clear, verifiable story about learning accomplishments, something that degrees and resumes often fail to do. Badges are shaking up education wherever and whenever learning happens, including in libraries. In this light workshop, find out how badges work, set up a “backpack,” earn your first badges, and talk about how this technology may impact our institutions’ roles in the learning ecosystem.</p><p><strong>Shiny, Happy People Holding Nodes: Using VIVO (a Semantic Web Application) to Reveal University of Idaho Research and Researchers</strong><br /><em>Annie Gaines, Scholarly Communications Librarian, University of Idaho<br />Devin Becker, Digital Initiatives Librarian, University of Idaho</em><br /><em>Jeremy Kenyon, Research Librarian, University of Idaho</em><br />In 2012, the University of Idaho Library began implementing VIVO, an open-source Semantic Web application, both as a discovery layer for its fledgling institutional repository and as a database to describe, visualize, and report university research activity. The presenters will detail some of the challenges they encountered developing this resource, while discussing the tools and techniques they used for obtaining, editing, and uploading institutional data into the RDF-based VIVO system.</p><p><strong>The Mobile Playground: Can Databases and iPads Play Nice?</strong><br /><em>Kelly Meadow, Summer Reference Intern 2013, University of Oregon (</em><a href="https://twitter.com/kellylmeadow">@kellylmeadow</a>)<br /><em>Ngoc-Yen Tran, Outreach and Student Engagement Librarian, University of Oregon</em><br />Tablets present many opportunities to enhance and increase library instruction, but it is unclear if library databases can rise to the challenge of tablet use. In our study, we used an iPad and tested the functionality of specific tasks that may be used in a library instruction setting. This session will explore the nitty gritty of using tablets for library instruction, leading to a better understanding of the future of mobile tablet classrooms.</p><p><a href="http://onlinenorthwest.org/about/blog/2014/3/5/responsive-web-design-a-future-friendly-web-strategy"><strong>Responsive Web Design: A Future-Friendly Web Strategy</strong></a><br /><em>Christine Tawatao, Systems Librarian: Web Development/Support, University of Washington Libraries</em> (<a href="https://twitter.com/tawataoc">@tawataoc</a>)<br />In just a few short years, the range of web-enabled devices on our campuses has exploded. The University of Washington Libraries has adopted responsive web design as a way to provide our content on whatever device comes our way. Learn why this is a good strategy for us, what tradeoffs are involved, why concise content is more important than ever, and strategies for conducting user research/testing to inform every step in the design process.</p><p><strong>Life Hacking Digital Tools for Classroom Assignments</strong><br /><em>Elizabeth Brookbank, Instruction Librarian, Western Oregon University<br />Robert Monge, Instruction Librarian, Western Oregon University</em> (<a href="https://twitter.com/Robert_Monge">@Robert_Monge</a>)<br />Students are increasingly being given digital assignments. Completing this work requires synthesizing complex subject matter with high end production values to produce content that is meaningful and engaging. The default option for completing these assignments is often a basic video or Prezi. This presentation highlights an instruction guide with essential digital media life hacks to inspire students to be more creative as they communicate their knowledge on a subject using digital tools.</p><p><strong>Use of Semantics to Promote Data Management and Discovery</strong><br /><em>Nicole Vasilevsky, Project Manager, Ontology Development Group, Oregon Health &amp; Science University (</em><a href="https://twitter.com/N_Vasilevsky">@n_vasilevsky</a>)<br /><em>Melissa Haendel, Lead Ontologist, Assistant Professor, Oregon Health &amp; Science University</em> (<a href="https://twitter.com/ontowonka">@ontowonka</a>)<br /><em>Jackie Wirz, Biomedical Sciences Librarian, Oregon Health &amp; Science University</em><br />As the amount of information and data increases, structuring data is important for discovery and retrieval. We will discuss use cases developed at the OHSU Library that demonstrate the value of using a formal system of logic and meaning (semantics) to structure, manage, and discover data. These tools and technologies can be used by libraries to advance information retrieval and discovery in their communities and to connect to the larger scholarly landscape.</p><p><a href="http://onlinenorthwest.org/about/blog/2014/3/6/discovering-open-access-content"><strong>Discovering Open Access Content: A Conversation</strong></a><br /><em>Jill Emery, Collection Development Librarian, Portland State University</em><br />Open access workflows in Academic Libraries (OAWAL) is an attempt to crowdsource the best practices for management of open access content within academic libraries. This presentation/discussion will focus on the segment concerned with discovery of OA content: the addition of global OA Content to library catalogs &amp; discovery systems, participation in OAISter, necessary metadata for discovery, exposure of local repository on Google, Indexing of gold OA journals and the need for OA designation, usage data (IRUS-UK, PIRUS). The intent is to seek input from the attendees on what else can aid with discovery of OA content.</p><p><strong>Code 101: A Very Basic Primer in HTML and CSS</strong><br /><em>Nyssa J. Walsh, Public Services Librarian, Oregon College of Oriental Medicine</em> (<a href="https://twitter.com/nyssaj">@nyssaj</a>)<br />Don't be intimidated by HTML and CSS! This workshop will give you an opportunity to experiment with mark-up languages so that you can learn to edit websites with ease. In this workshop participants will create an (unpublished) website and interact in an online "sandbox" for basic website design. This class is intended for beginners, but anyone interested in learning more is welcome! A limited number of laptops will be available, so please bring yours along.</p><p><a href="http://onlinenorthwest.org/about/blog/2014/3/4/information-literacy-privacy-risk-what-are-the-implications-of-mass-surveillance-for-libraries"><strong>Information Literacy, Privacy, &amp; Risk: What Are the Implications of Mass Surveillance for Libraries?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</a><br /><em>Gabe Gossett, Librarian for Extended Education, Western Washington University&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Brian Davidson, Career and Academic Advisor, Whatcom Community College&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</em><br /><em>Rebecca Wilder, Attorney (Washington state), Research Paralegal, Adjunct Instructor&nbsp; </em><br />&nbsp;In light of new revelations about government warrantless wiretapping and electronic surveillance what role do librarians have in educating our patrons about digital privacy and security issues? Given that digital privacy is further complicated by for-profit Internet companies services, such as those provided by Facebook and Google, are our users savvy enough to understand threats to their information in this increasingly complex digital landscape?&nbsp; This presentation will explore issues related to current events and information security with an eye towards the implications for information literacy standards; brief examination of tools used to enhance information privacy; and discuss how librarians might play a role in helping users become more information aware&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://onlinenorthwest.org/about/blog/2014/3/6/research-communication-workshop"><strong>Research Communication Workshop</strong></a><br /><em>Nicole Vasilevsky, Project Manager, Ontology Development Group, Oregon Health &amp; Science University (</em><a href="https://twitter.com/N_Vasilevsky">@n_vasilevsky</a>)<br /><em>Melissa Haendel, Lead Ontologist, Assistant Professor, Oregon Health &amp; Science University</em> (<a href="https://twitter.com/ontowonka">@ontowonka</a>)<br /><em>Jackie Wirz, Biomedical Sciences Librarian, Oregon Health &amp; Science University<br />Robin Champieux, Scholarly Communication Librarian, Oregon Health &amp; Science University</em><br />The library’s role in offering services related to data management and effective research communication is becoming of increasing importance in academic institutions. The goal of this workshop is to discuss how effective data management and scholarly communication can enhance reproducibility of academic outputs and contribute to improved impact. In this workshop, we will teach some key skills which can be disseminated to researchers and students, giving librarians the tools not only to understand the changing landscape of scholarly communication and data management in the digital age, but also how to effectively teach the importance and impact of these practices.</p><p><a href="http://onlinenorthwest.org/about/blog/2014/3/6/everyone-has-an-ebook-in-them-teaching-a-create-your-own-ebook-class"><strong>Everyone Has an (E)Book in Them: Teaching a Create Your Own EBook Class</strong></a><br /><em>Lorena O'English, Social Sciences Librarian, Washington State University Pullman</em> (<span><a href="https://twitter.com/wsulorena">@wsulorena</a>)</span><br />In recent years there has been extensive discussion about the role librarians can play in working with library patrons who want to create their own new works, whether through makerspaces, crafting groups, etc. This presentation will describe the results of one librarian’s initiative to teach classes (“Create Your Own (Basic) Ebook Using Open Source Software”) on how to create and manage ebooks (with text and images) that can be read on smartphones, tablets, and ereaders. The presentation will include a description of the initiative as well as its successes, challenges, and possibilities for duplication.<br /><br /><strong>Device Agnostic Discovery Using Drupal and Bibliocommons</strong><br /><em>Stephanie Miller, Access Services Librarian, Multnomah County Library<br />Arlene Keller, Web Services Coordinator, Multnomah County Library</em> (<a href="https://twitter.com/MultCoLib">@multcolib</a>)<br />Multnomah County Library recently won a national award for its new responsive website, which officially launched in February 2013 along with the BiblioCommons discovery layer. Learn about the goals and successes (and lessons learned) of the redesign, including: the implementation of an integrated search experience using Apachs Solr and the BiblioCommons API; providing a responsive patron experience; aligning the discovery layer and Drupal website; using Drupal taxonomies for discovery and organization; and streamlining content creation and editing.</p><h2>Lightning Talks</h2><p><a href="http://onlinenorthwest.org/about/blog/2014/taking-the-slow-books-revolution-online"><strong>Taking the Slow Book Revolution Online: Virtual Readers’ Advisory in the Academic Library</strong></a><br /><em>Elizabeth Brookbank, Instruction Librarian, Western Oregon University</em></p><p><a href="http://onlinenorthwest.org/about/blog/2014/3/6/the-mobile-landscape-mobile-literacy-and-libraries-2014"><strong>The Mobile Landscape, Mobile Literacy, and Libraries</strong></a><br /><em>Robin Ashford, Reference Librarian, George Fox University<br />Laura Zeigen, User Experience Librarian, Oregon Health Sciences University</em><br /><br /><a href="http://onlinenorthwest.org/about/blog/2014/3/5/streaming-video-demands-in-the-face-of-institutional-drift"><strong>Streaming Video Demands in the Face of Institutional Drift</strong></a><br /><em>Gabe Gossett, Librarian for Extended Education, Human Services, and International Studies, Western Washington University</em></p><p><a href="http://onlinenorthwest.org/about/blog/2014/3/4/choose-your-own-research-adventure"><strong>"Choose Your Own (Research) Adventure" : Creating Engaging Online Activities with Google Forms</strong></a><br /><em>Candise Branum, Director of Library Services, Oregon College of Oriental Medicine</em></p><p><a href="http://onlinenorthwest.org/about/blog/2014/4/8/twitter-graduate-school-teaching-health-sciences-students-to-utilize-social-media-to-address-issues-in-healthcare"><strong>Twitter Graduate School: Teaching Health Sciences Students to Utilize Social Media to Address Issues in Healthcare</strong></a><br /><em>Patricia Devine, Network Outreach Coordinator, National Network of Libraries of Medicine</em></p><p><a href="http://onlinenorthwest.org/about/blog/2014/3/3/kmry4p9djoqpwvg4xigfqwoffilzsr"><strong>Learning the Lay of the Land: Defining and Documenting Where Instruction Happens in Order to Target Program Improvement</strong></a><br /><em>Steve Borrelli, Instructional Design Librarian &amp; Assessment Team Leader, Washington State University<br />Corey Johnson, Head of Library Instruction, Washington State University</em></p><p><a href="http://onlinenorthwest.org/about/blog/2014/3/3/how-to-have-a-student-centered-approach-to-social-media-perspectives-from-library-staff-and-student-assistant"><strong>How to Have a Student-Centered Approach to Social Media: Perspectives From Library Staff and Student Assistant</strong></a><br /><em>Justyne Triest, Evening Supervisor, Linfield College<br />Alyssa Townsend, Linfield College</em></p><hr />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Information for Conference Presenters</h1><ul><li><p>Two presenters from each session (excluding lightning-talkers) pay a discounted registration cost.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;Most of the attendees are librarians from the academic community, but we are seeing increasing attendance from public, special, and school libraries, as well as others from the information industry. Your presentation should be directed at the moderate to experienced user. Emphasize the practical.</p></li><li><p>Programs are forty-five minutes in length. Please structure your program so that there is at least 5 minutes at the end for questions. Past conference attendees have commented that this is often the richest part of the program for them. Members of the conference committee will be on hand to provide time cues.</p></li><li><p>Attendees may spend the first few minutes of the session "shopping around" for a program; expect to see several people arriving up to five minutes into your program, but don't feel that you have to back up in your program and bring them up to speed — they'll catch up.</p></li><li><p>You are strongly encouraged to make any handouts, Powerpoint presentations, and supplementary materials available via a web site, and to send the URL to the conference committee after the conference is over. The conference committee will post the link from the PSU conference website to your presentation materials following the conference.</p></li><li><p>Each conference room will be equipped with a laptop PC, LCD video projector, and Internet access. If you have further audiovisual needs, please contact Stephanie Doig (smdoig@pdx.edu).</p></li><li><p>If you use Powerpoint, test your presentation on more than one computer, as well as with the Powerpoint viewer,&nbsp;<em>before</em>&nbsp;you leave for the conference.</p></li><li><p>The conference committee makes every effort to accommodate conference participants and presenters with special needs. If, as a presenter, you receive a request from someone with special needs, we encourage you to accommodate them as much as possible.

      <title>History</title>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2016 16:50:37 +0000</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Conference History</h2><p>The Online Northwest Conference (originally called Oregon Online)&nbsp;began in 1984, created by librarians at the nine schools of the Oregon State System of Higher Education (OSSHE) and the Inter-institutional Library Council (ILC). At the time, the members of the conference organizing committee were known as the OSSHE ILC Online Coordinators Committee. The Online Coordinators were involved in searching online databases, which were then only accessible by librarians with specialized technical knowledge in the arcane language of database searching. The conference was established as an opportunity for librarians across the OSSHE to share their knowledge and experience with the frequent technological changes in libraries. Conference presentations at Online Northwest have also been, and continue to be, an excellent professional development opportunity for librarians.&nbsp;</p><p>Around 1990 the name of the conference changed to Online Northwest, helping to attract librarians and other information professionals from Washington, Idaho, Montana, and northern California.&nbsp;The conference is regularly attended by librarians from higher education, as well as an increasing amount of librarians from public and special libraries. Over the years, the conference evolved into one of the most-beloved library conferences in the region. Presentations address technical, social, and policy issues associated with information technology and librarianship.&nbsp;</p><p>In June 2015 the Oregon University System <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_University_System">officially disbanded</a>.&nbsp; As a result, the Online Northwest conference committee took a hiatus in 2016, using the time to explore options to continue the conference without OUS backing.&nbsp; Portland State University Library agreed to provide Online Northwest with logistical support and a home, beginning with the 2017 conference.</p><h2>Who Organizes Online Northwest?</h2><p>Each former Oregon University System institution library—Eastern Oregon University, Oregon Institute of Technology, Oregon State University, Portland State University, Southern Oregon University, University of Oregon, Western Oregon University, and Oregon Health Sciences University—chooses a representative to serve on a committee that plans all aspects of Online Northwest.&nbsp; Portland State University Library staff facilitate conference logistics and the Portland State University Library provides a home for Online Northwest as of the 2017 conference.</p><h2>how is online northwest changing?</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong> Why did Online Northwest skip a year?<br /><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp; There was no conference in 2016 for a couple of reasons.&nbsp; Online Northwest was a conference of the Oregon University System.&nbsp; When that organization officially dissolved in June 2015, the conference no longer had an organizational “home.”&nbsp; After the 2015 conference, the conference program planning committee conducted a broad survey of recent Online Northwest participants and used that feedback to guide an investigation of ways to continue the conference.&nbsp; The gap year provided time to evaluate pros and cons, as well as firm up logistics.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong> Why is Online Northwest 2017 in Portland instead of Corvallis?<br /><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong> Because the Oregon University System no longer exists, Online Northwest needed a new institutional “home.”&nbsp; Portland State University is the conference’s new organizational sponsor and site.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong> What other changes are you making?<br /><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong> Not too many!&nbsp; Online Northwest will still be a springtime one-day regional conference focusing on instructional technology and libraries.&nbsp; We’re still exploring ways to adjust the theme of the conference to provide the most interesting and engaging program.&nbsp; If you have questions or ideas about how to improve the conference, please feel free to email either of the 2017 co-chairs, <a target="_blank" href="mailto:blake.galbreath@wsu.edu">Blake Galbreath</a> or <a target="_blank" href="mailto:kmunro@uoregon.edu">Karen Munro</a>.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong> What is the timeline for the 2017 conference?<br /><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong> We expect to issue our call for program proposals in early September 2016, with a deadline in early November.&nbsp; The program will be made public and registration will be available in late 2016 and early 2017.&nbsp; The next Online Northwest conference will be held March 31, 2017 at Portland State University.</p><p> </p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote>Software programming is the future and the present and the unknown.&nbsp; More and more librarians want to learn to code, whether to improve their workflows and services, to communicate better with their vendors and IT personnel, or simply for lifelong learning as information professionals. But this raises all kinds of questions: what obstacles stop us from learning, and how do we get around them?&nbsp; Why this skill, when there are so many others that are also relevant in libraries?&nbsp; And more personal questions, too, about diversity and identity and sometimes even courage.</blockquote><blockquote>This talk is about asking questions.&nbsp; It's about telling stories and containing multitudes and sketching out a hacker epistemology.&nbsp; Let's all of us afterward have a conversation.</blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Committee is inviting our speakers to provide their presentations in the digital format of their choosing, to be published here on the ONW website. We're working with Andromeda Yelton to either record or broadcast her keynote. There are still door prizes too! We're aiming for the first week of March.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Richard A. Stoddart, Oregon State University Libraries &amp; Press<br />Jane Nichols, Oregon State University Libraries &amp; Press<br />Terry Reese, Ohio State University</em></p><p>Hello,</p><p>On behalf of my colleagues Jane Nichols and Terry Reese, I am excited to share our presentation slides for Online Northwest. We&nbsp;hoped&nbsp;to&nbsp;discuss ideas about research methodology and the use of this&nbsp;new&nbsp;survey tooldeveloped by Terry Reese&nbsp;with&nbsp;the in-person audience. What&nbsp;tool, you ask? --- Well, you will have to dive into the content to see but let's just say Mr. Reese's research tool allows libraries to insert an online survey in front of electronic journals. Boy-howdy that's pretty cool.</p><p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Since this is the Snowstorm Edition, we&nbsp;are&nbsp;happy to get feedback from Online NW attendees about the questions asked in our presentation. We also&nbsp;have already fielded a few phone calls and emails regarding this&nbsp;software&nbsp;and would be happy to talk with you about&nbsp;it&nbsp;in more detail if interested.</p><p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">Additional context for this presentation is available from a previous talk that was done at the 2013 Charleston Conference.

      <title>Taking the Slow Books Revolution Online: Virtual Readers’ Advisory in the Academic Library</title>
      <link>/about/blog/2014/taking-the-slow-books-revolution-online</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Elizabeth Brookbank, Instruction Librarian, Western Oregon University</em></p><p><span>The Slow Book Revolution is about encouraging narrative-length, self-directed reading without distractions – reading that is sustained and requires critical thinking and creativity.&nbsp;College students, one of the least read populations in the country, should be encouraged to spend their leisure time absorbed in a dialogue with a good book.&nbsp;Who better to guide this age group toward good books and slow reading than the academic librarians that interact with them every day? This lightning talk will discuss the place of readers’ advisory in academic libraries and effective&nbsp;ways to promote recreational books and encourage a culture of reading on campus through online tools&nbsp;such as blogs, social media, and library websites.&nbsp;</span></p>

      <title>Strange New World: Linked Data for Catalogers and Metadata Librarians</title>
      <link>/about/blog/2014/3/3/strange-new-world-linked-data-for-catalogers-and-metadata-librarians</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span>Jessica Hayden, Technical Services Manager, University of Northern Colorado</span></em></p><p>Abstract:</p><p>Linked data has been hailed as a disruptive innovation that will change the way we organize and discover information, but what does it really mean for catalogers and metadata creators? This presentation will cover the background of linked data and demonstrate developments that take advantage of it. It will highlight projects of particular interest to librarians including the Library of Congress Bibliographic Framework Initiative. A portion of the session will be devoted to using linked data sources such as VIAF and the Open Metadata Registry to create a bibliographic record in BibFrame. The presentation will include discussion of current systems limitations and ways to utilize linked data outside our current ILS. Librarians will walk away with an understanding of how linked data will affect their work in the future, and they will learn about tools to begin utilizing linked data now to expose some of their collections.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Candise Branum, Director of Library Services, Oregon College of Oriental Medicine</em></p><p>Abstract: Creating online activities that are actually engaging can be a challenge -- students with short attention spans often skim (or completely skip over) the content that librarian instructors painstakingly spend hours building. For those who have adopted the flipped classroom model, getting students to actively engage in the homework is a key component of the process, but can be difficult in real practice. In this presentation, you'll learn the benefit of creating your own online Choose Your Own Adventure using Google Forms or Inklewriter. With as many different paths or endings as you can write, these interactive lessons can be embedded into course management systems or subject guides to support online learners, and can also be used for learning assessment.</p><p>Choose your presentation here:&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://writer.inklestudios.com/stories/8c3v">http://writer.inklestudios.com/stories/8c3v</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Digital Badges in Libraries: Skills-based instruction, code-shifting, and collaboration</title>
      <link>/about/blog/2014/3/4/digital-badges-in-libraries-skills-based-instruction-code-shifting-and-collaboration</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Emily Ford, Urban &amp; Public Affairs Librarian, Portland State University<br />Nicholas Schiller, Systems &amp; Instruction Librarian, Washington State University- Vancouver<br />Dawn Richardson, Assistant Professor of Community Health, Portland State University</em><br /> </p><p><span style="font-size:15px">Abstract: Digital badges present librarians with new ways of engaging with patrons including recognizing patron achievement and improved communication. This session will provide an overview of digital badges--including an explanation of underlying pedagogical aims--and will address badging as “code-shifting” or using different communication methods for different audiences. Finally, it will present a major collaboration between Portland State University Library and disciplinary faculty to integrate badges in undergraduate courses, providing librarian and disciplinary faculty perspectives.</span></p><p> </p><p>In our presentation for Online Northwest we hoped to provide a basic overview of digital badges, discuss theoretical underpinnings of badges that lead to using badges for instruction, to shift “code” (or how we perceive institutional systems and instruction), and to discuss a collaborative project that is currently developing a digital badge curriculum for information literacy and critical thinking in undergraduate Community Health courses at Portland State University.</p><p><em>What are badges and how might they be used?</em></p><p>First off, digital badges stem from the traditional American notion of scouting. In scouting badges represented an achievement, knowledge, or skills gained by an individual. (The First Aid badge is a classic example.) Digital badges are the same; they are visual representations of an achievement, knowledge, or skills gained by an individual. Conversely, this is exactly what a college diploma cannot do. It cannot represent skills such as critical thinking or information literacy. It cannot show that a student is a good writer, information evaluator, leader, etc.</p><p>Increasingly students of higher education want to know what they are learning and want to understand the value it will bring them in their future lives. They want to be able to communicate their skills and knowledge gained. Badges can assist in doing just that. Badges can credential achievements at a more granular level than can grades or a diploma. Badges can assist students in becoming more aware about how their learning fits into the outcomes or goals expressed by an instructor. Moreover, badges pose a great opportunity for faculty to better track and assess student achievement. Theoretically, when a student who has earned badges enters a class, an instructor would quickly be able to know what skills that student already has, and where they are lacking.</p><p><em>Where are badges being used?</em></p><p><span style="font-size:15px">Much of the work that is currently being done with badges in higher education is due to a </span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.macfound.org/programs/digital-badges/"><span style="font-size:15px">MacArthur Foundation</span></a><span style="font-size:15px"> funding initiative in partnership with the </span><a target="_blank" href="http://openbadges.org/"><span style="font-size:15px">Mozilla Foundation</span></a><span style="font-size:15px">. Their </span><a target="_blank" href="http://dmlcompetition.net/"><span style="font-size:15px">Digital Media and Learning Competition</span></a><span style="font-size:15px"> is administered by </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hastac.org/collections/digital-badges"><span style="font-size:15px">HASTAC</span></a><span style="font-size:15px"> (Humanities, Arts, Sciences, and Technology Alliance Collaboratory) and puts tens of thousands of dollars each year to digital learning projects. Of course badges aren’t necessarily tied to formal education or learning. The location-based social media platform </span><a target="_blank" href="https://foursquare.com/"><span style="font-size:15px">FourSquare</span></a><span style="font-size:15px"> offers </span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.4squarebadges.com/"><span style="font-size:15px">badges</span></a><span style="font-size:15px"> for achievements tied to an individual’s accomplishments within the platform. Similarly, </span><a target="_blank" href="https://untappd.com/"><span style="font-size:15px">Untappd</span></a>, a social media platform for beer geeks, credentials individual achievements with badges.</p><p><em>So how can this translate into a changed understanding or approach to higher education?</em></p><p>Shifting “code” or how students and instructors alike see and understand goals of higher education is one theoretical underpinning of badges. Code has many layers in any higher educational institution, from a university’s learning outcomes, to those articulated by the departments, and those by the library. There are also accreditors, provosts, and faculty/librarians represented in code layers. To a student, and sometimes even to the faculty member teaching a course, these layers do not often make sense. Using badges--visual elements-- in a course on its syllabus and lecture materials, and during lectures themselves, can help shift our learning “code.”</p><p><em>The PSU Project</em></p><p><span style="font-size:15px">Late in 2012, Portland State University Provost Sona Andrews announced a $3 million internal grant competition called </span><a target="_blank" href="http://rethink.pdx.edu/"><span style="font-size:15px">reTHINK PSU</span></a><span style="font-size:15px">. The goal of this process was: “To deliver an education that serves more students with better outcomes, while containing costs through curricular innovation, community engagement, and effective use of technology.” reTHINK PSU offered three levels of grants: Acceleration Challenge--to implement high-impact clusters of online classes; Reframing Challenge--to fund collaborative projects using technology that result in delivery of high-quality, affordable education; and Inspiration Challenge--to fund projects that develop technology-based solutions that improve student success. The Inspiration Challenge category, which funded up to $20,000 for projects, seemed like a perfect opportunity to address address how information literacy instruction was embedded in the Community Health curriculum. As a result, </span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.pdx.edu/oai/provosts-challenge-projects-139"><span style="font-size:15px">Digital Badges for Creativity and Critical Thinking</span></a> was born.</p><p><span style="font-size:15px">The project, Digital Badges for Creativity and Critical Thinking, is at its core a curriculum mapping and instructional design project. Faculty members in the </span><a target="_blank" href="http://pdx.edu/sch"><span style="font-size:15px">School of Community Health</span></a><span style="font-size:15px">, </span><a target="_blank" href="http://library.pdx.edu/"><span style="font-size:15px">Library</span></a><span style="font-size:15px">, and </span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.pdx.edu/oai/"><span style="font-size:15px">Office of Academic Innovation</span></a><span style="font-size:15px"> are working together to develop a badge curriculum. The project, which is a “proof-of-concept” project, will launch badges in three undergraduate Community Health courses in Fall 2014. In these courses our hope is that badges will help students better understand their accomplishments and skills gained in critical thinking and information literacy. Moreover, the project is a way for the team to think through how information literacy components are embedded into undergraduate curriculum, and forge pathways for more instructional design work to be accomplished in other courses in the future.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meggie Wright, Oregon State University, @meggiewright</p><p>Nate Otto, Indiana University, @ottonomy</p><p><span style="font-size:12px">The Mozilla Foundation’s Open Badges are a new technology that makes it possible for anyone to issue, earn, and display proof of an educational achievement. Open Badges are digital tokens, like merit badges you might receive in the real world. They can be displayed on websites, job sites, and social media. Badges can be used to tell a clear, verifiable story about learning accomplishments, something that degrees and resumes often fail to do. Badges are shaking up education wherever and whenever learning happens, including in libraries. In this digital workshop, find out how badges work, set up a “backpack,” earn your first badge, and think about how this technology may impact our institutions’ roles in the learning ecosystem.</span></p>

<p><strong>Presentation Notes: Twitter Graduate School: Teaching Health Sciences Students to Utilize Soc</strong><strong>ial Media to Address Issues in Healthcare</strong></p><p>Although many use Twitter for fun, to read celebrity gossip, and to keep up with friends, it is also a powerful current awareness tool. According to a May 2013 survey by the Pew Internet Project, 85% of adults in the United States use the internet. 72% of these internet users looked for health information online in the past year. And 73% of adults who are online use some type of social networking. Twitter is one of the places people look for health information.</p><p>In addition to knowing what’s out there in order to keep abreast of what patients are finding, healthcare providers can also use Twitter and other social media to share information themselves. In addition to keeping track of what’s going on in their field, it can serve as a current awareness tool and connect them to others with similar interests doing similar work. Thanks to link shortening services, you don’t really have to say everything in 140 characters or less. Twitter can be used to send links to articles, comment on others’ content and to connect.</p><p>In order to make Twitter work for you, finding the right people to put in your network is key. Searching by organization helps you find other like-minder users. Searching geographically can also help build your network, finding others in your region who serve the same kind of patient population, for example. This enhances your connections in your community, both virtual and physical.</p><p>Once you have built a network of trusted sources, which is evaluated based on the contents of their tweets, you can being to rely on the information they share. A trusted source will be an advantage to you in your quest to keep up in your field and stay abreast of changes.</p><p>To enhance these connections, you can add followers based on who is posting about topics you’re interested in. Once you have identified a good participant for your network, checking to see who they are following, or including in their network, is a good way to reach out and enlarge your network. It’s always a work in progress, adding or deleting based on which content is most relevant to you.</p><p>Using hashtags, or subjects, is a good way to identify more relevant content. You may search whatever interests you, then note in the search results if there is a hashtag people are using. Conference hashtags are also a good way to connect. Sometimes at conferences participants discover each other while</p><p>they’re attending the same session, based on their Twitter comments. The Symplur Health Care Hashtag Project is a way to find out what hashtags people are using. Symplur is a Project aimed at facilitating communication between healthcare providers and patients and enhancing and improving providers’ participation in social media in order to educate themselves and to steer the public towards better resources.</p><p>And finally, another way to participate more fully in what Twitter has to offer is to take part in Twitter chats, where all the participants use the same hashtag at a specified time. Health-related chats are listed on the Symplur website under the Health Care Hashtag Project, which also provides transcripts of the chats. Chats usually last an hour and are advertised on Twitter and in blogs, and participants can join the conversation but also just see what others are doing. Past chats can be searched as well.</p><p>Knowing what’s going on via Twitter and sharing information with colleagues and patients is a good way take advantage of what social media has to offer.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>Slide 1: </strong>No notes</p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><strong>Slide 2:</strong> <span style="font-size:11.0pt">Imagine being able to take library instruction anywhere with a wireless internet connection, regardless of space constraints or technology capabilities, giving students hands-on experience with library resources. </span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">There is a teaching space at the Knight Library at the University of Oregon that no librarian wants to reserve for instruction. Kelly Meadow was completing an internship in the Reference and Research Services Department at the University of Oregon Libraries as Yen Tran and Barbara Jenkins were exploring options to break free from spaces such as the one at Knight Library. Kelly and Yen collaborated on this study that takes the </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt">first practical step in understanding how tablets can be used to create a kind of mobile classroom or mobile playground. </span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Slide 3: </span></strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Tablets offer us the opportunity to take library instruction to any classroom, regardless of layout or computer options.</span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Looking at library literature, we saw that the use of tablets for formal library instruction was very sparse. Most of the literature address the topics of reference services (think: roving librarians), tablet lending programs, use in clinical settings, and use for self-guided tours.</span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Examples of library instruction with tablets included:</span></p><ul><li style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Using QR codes (or Quick Response codes) to conduct library sessions </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt">(</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt">think: </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt">scavenger hunt)</span></li><li style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">At the University of Wyoming, the librarians adapted a concept mapping activity usually done on paper into tablet format with a first year composition course</span></li><li style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Boston College Law School, librarians piloted iPads in a semester-long upper-level credit legal course</span></li></ul><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Effectiveness varied: of the studies mentioned above, some found students to be more engaged using a tablet while others found it distracting for students and not effective. Even so, the New Media Consortium’s Horizon Report Higher Education Edition has included tablet computing on their list of influential technologies for teaching and learning since 2010. Their 2013 report indicated that tablets were “proving to be powerful tools for learning inside and outside of the classroom.” Additionally, tablet ownership is on the rise. According to a Pew study, tablet ownership amongst U.S. adults 18+ has doubled to 34% in 2013. With this, it has become more important for us to look at how library resources (specifically databases) functioned on tablets.</span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Prior to our research, we did not have a good idea of how well our primary playground (that is: library databases), functioned on a tablet. So we designed a study to determine the feasibility of using iPads for library instruction.</span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Slide 4: </span></strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Before we begin, we want you to try accessing your favorite database (or maybe your go-to database) from a tablet and imagine that you are demoing it to a class. Focus on what worked and what did not work.</span></p><ul><li style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">What worked and what did not work?</span></li><li style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Have you used iPads for library instruction?</span></li><li style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Have you used your library databases on an iPad and what was the experience like?</span></li></ul><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><strong>Slide 5:</strong> <span style="font-size:11.0pt">We decided to visit each of the library’s databases listed on the A-Z list with an iPad and compare the experience with a desktop computer. In order to measure what we tested, we looked at five basic functions used during an instruction session:</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Presentation of the page: We looked at whether or not the page presented itself as it should on the iPad. We were not measuring the actual design of the page. </span></li><li><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Access to multimedia content</span><strong>:</strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt"> The iPad does not play nicely with Flash and Java, so we looked at how multimedia displayed in each database. </span></li><li><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Database specific tools</span><strong>: </strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt">This category is somewhat ambiguous. If a database offered special tools that were important to that database, such as citation mapping, or exporting citations, we looked at how well these things worked. Most of the tools measured were citation export tools, which might be less essential to many lower level students. </span></li><li><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Email full-text: The personal nature of the iPad requires that an individual email account be associated with the device in order to email one’s self a PDF. It is preferable in an instruction session if the students have the ability to email a PDF or HTML full text within the database itself. We evaluated each database for this feature. Databases offering citation indexes, abstracting, or audio and video streaming were coded as “not applicable.”<span>&nbsp; </span>Databases featuring full text articles, digital collections, data, tables, or visual material were considered to be full text. </span></li><li><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Separate app required</span><strong>: </strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt">If a database required a separate app in order to function on an iPad, it would create a barrier to an instruction session. Thus, we looked to see if an app was required. </span></li></ul><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><strong>Slide 6: </strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt">After identifying what functions we wanted to measure, we created a coding system that divided each task into four areas of functionality:</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Fully functional: This meant that the task was completed as expected. Or, in other words, the task functioned exactly as it would if it was being accessed from a laptop or desktop.</span></li><li><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Requires workaround: Sometimes there is a workaround. For example, if the in-database PDF is not functioning, there is the option to save and view the PDF in iBooks. If functionality is compromised in some way, it was also coded a this.</span></li><li><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Not functional: When all is lost and functionality cannot be resolved or the task is not possible within the database, it was coded as not functional. </span></li><li><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Not applicable: Not all the functions tested was available in every databased. Therefore, this code was used when the task did not apply to that particular database. For example, databases without multimedia materials.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></li></ul><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><strong>Slide 7:</strong> <span style="font-size:11.0pt">Responsive web design is an approach that takes the user into account, which also includes looking at screen size. In other words, how can the user’s experience with the website be optimized so that resizing, zooming, and panning is not required - especially on a smaller screen. That’s why we decided to look at the presentation of the content and design of the page. </span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Overall, the databases had very little issue displaying content on an iPad versus a desktop or laptop computer. 380 (91.1%) were fully functional, 23 (5.5%) required a work-around, 9 (32.2%) were simply not functional, and 5 (1.2%) were not applicable. The not applicable results were due to databases whose servers were down or the database could not be evaluated in some way. </span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">The reasons varied for the databases that were not functional, but a lot had do with Java and Flash issues, the need to download additional software before use, or the page would not load. </span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Databases that had workarounds included the usual suspects when you think about viewing webpages on a smaller screen: incorrect display of features, menu, options, and content. The other issues were responsive web design issues including the inability to see the entire screen without having to scroll left and right, text being so small you had to zoom in, and content-dense pages. There were even one or two incidences where the entire left or right side of the page was cut off entirely.</span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Slide 8: </span></strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt">If we look at the top 7 vendors, the results also look good. There is one vendor that stands out because as the 3rd largest vendor with 43 databases, many of the databases required a workaround or were not functional.</span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><strong>Slide 9: </strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Out of the 418 databases listed, only 126 (30.1%) of the total databases offered multimedia content. A major concern while beginning the study was the iPad's inability to use Adobe Flash or Java, however there were only five databases that exclusively required some sort of software that was not installed on the iPad. The majority of the partially functional databases were coded as such because the multimedia content was in a variety of formats and functionality depended upon the format of the content.</span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><strong>Slide 10:</strong> <span style="font-size:11.0pt">If we focus on the darker gray areas of this figure, we can see that ProQuest, Gale, and Alexander Street Press pose some problems. However, </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt">the majority (77%) of applicable databases with multimedia content were fully or partially functional. For instruction, this means that a tablet classroom and the use of tablets to demonstrate multimedia materials is not a large hurdle.</span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><strong>Slide 11:</strong> <span style="font-size:11.0pt">Some databases have specific or specialized tools available to researchers, such as citation export options, visualization tools, table or graph creation, and data exportation. </span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Although this category of evaluation is somewhat ambiguous due to the variety of tools available within databases of various subjects,<span>&nbsp; </span>the majority of the non-functioning and partially functioning tools were those involving the exportation of citations. Many citation export tools within databases require that a .txt or .ris file be downloaded, and this is not possible on an iPad. In cases where the citation could be automatically loaded into software by logging into an online account on the web, the citation software could be more useful to students. The use of citation export tools is likely limited to upper level or graduate students, whereas data visualization or data exportation tools may have more significance to a broader student population.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Overall, the tools available within a database were functional. </span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Slide 12: </span></strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt">When considering the top 7 most common vendors, it is clear that tools do not pose a problem for library instruction, especially since these activities may not be widely used among introductory courses and undergraduates. </span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><strong>Slide 13: </strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Often, library sessions allocate time at the end of class for students to explore the databases themselves and to begin looking for sources for the assignment. Emailing full-text to themselves is an essential function in this process. This area, we found, was the most problematic of our results. Of the 418 databases tested, 92 (22.1%) were fully functional, 5 (1.2%) databases required some sort of work-around, 176 (42.2%) were simply not functional, and 144 (34.5%) of the databases were coded as not applicable. In other words, excluding the non-applicable databases, almost 2 out of 3 databases do not allow students to email full text articles to themselves.</span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">But the overall picture is not completely lost because there could be workarounds for this issue. An idea we thought of was to create a generic account on each iPad and sending the PDF from there via “iBooks”. This option would require extra maintenance and IT staff time as well as privacy concerns for students, which is why even if this was a workaround, we still coded the database as not functional.</span><strong> </strong></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Slide 14: </span></strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Depending on the vendor, the ability of email full-text is slightly better. For example, all of EBSCOhost’s applicable databases (30 out of 54) were fully functional. The reason for this is that the email option is a pop-up window within the database where the email can be sent from; Gale and ProQuest require the email to be sent from the email account set up on the tablet.</span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><strong>Slide 15: </strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt">As the results indicate, a separate app or specific software is not required for a database to operate on an iPad. Even so, thinking about responsive web design, many of the vendors have created separate apps for their resources. </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt">According to recent studies (ComScore White Paper referenced in Library Technology Reports) we know that users overwhelmingly prefer native apps to web apps, so that should be taken into consideration when considering the apps available from vendors. </span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">These are just some examples. </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt">We did not explore separate apps because we wanted to look more at accessing the database via a pre-installed app on every device: the web browser. There is endless potential for developing library instruction sessions based solely on vendor apps. Whether or not vendors have native apps that offer the same capabilities and results as the desktop version would require further research.</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span>Slide 16: </span></span></strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt">If we are simply considering our results, there are some barriers, such as emailing full text, that would require some sort of work-around resulting in extra IT staff time and maintenance. It is also important to know the specific limitations of the databases requiring Flash and Java. </span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">The set-up and maintenance of the mobile classroom would require a significant investment of time from staff. Ultimately, students’ comfort or discomfort with this technology could require extra time during a 50 minute instruction session. It is worth considering whether or not the benefits of flexibility and mobility outweigh the costs of staff time and class time. As use of tablets increases over time, and practices such as responsive web design become more prolific, hopefully these barriers will dissipate. </span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Slide 17: </span></strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt">We now know that databases function relatively well on an iPad, and this will likely improve as tablets become more prolific. Overall, the presentation of the page was comparable to that of a desktop or laptop computer. Tools that are specific to the databases worked relatively well. Access to multimedia content was less of an issue than expected. And when we look at common vendors, the results get better. Emailing full-text of articles is less than ideal but it is also dependent on vendors. </span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">With these kinds of results, are we given the go ahead to invest in the Mobile Playground?</span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Slide 18: </span></strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Please contact us with questions or further information.</span></p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"><strong>Slide 19:</strong> No notes</p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"> </p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"> </p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"> </p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"> </p><p style="margin-left:0in; text-align:left"> </p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>KEYNOTE</h2><p><a href="http://leddy.uwindsor.ca/staff/mita-williams">Mita Williams</a>, User Experience Librarian at the University of Windsor, will start off the day with her keynote presentation:&nbsp;</p><p><em>Teach for America. Code for America. Librarianing for America.</em></p><p>The motto for Code for America is "a new kind of public service".&nbsp; The motto of CrisisCommons is "we help connect people to help those in need".&nbsp;This talk is not going to dwell on the matter that librarians lack a good word - much less an official motto - that describes the work that we do. Instead, a case will be made for a new program to be designed to get more librarians working within more organizations in more communities.</p><h2 style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">Program</h2><h3><strong>Session One (10:10 - 10:55)</strong></h3><h2><span style="font-size:13px">Can You Kern? Online and Print Design for Librarians (ballroom)</span></h2><p>Diana K. Wakimoto, Associate Librarian, California State University, East Bay</p><p>Everyone now has the possibility of being their own graphic designer, but it can be hard to know where to start. We’ll discuss design basics, resources, software, and go over examples of the good, the bad, and the fixable in library design—both in print and online. Great design is easier than you think and with some simple tips and tricks you’ll be ready to tackle the next graphic design task at your library.</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="http://goo.gl/2qO5mi">Presentation slides</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://goo.gl/8gh9qv">Handout</a></li></ul><h2><span style="font-size:13px">Leaving Silos on the Farm: A Sustainable Solution for Distributing eBooks (rm 111)</span></h2><p>Hutch Tibbetts, Web Content Developer, Douglas County Libraries</p><p>Douglas County Libraries won a grant based on their eBook model to provide a platform for the state, eVoke Colorado. Initiated several years ago, and discussed here previously, this session provides new insight into their progress, partnering with Spain-based Odilo to deliver eBooks and eAudio, as well as downloadable music and video, through their catalog. Ideally suited for consortia, library networks, and state-wide platforms, it eliminates content silos, making the patron experience second to none.</p><h2><span style="font-size:13px">Digital Badges: A Tool for Embedded Library Instruction (rm 114)</span></h2><p>Emily Ford, Urban &amp; Public Affairs Librarian, Portland State University<br />Betty Izumi, Assistant Professor of Community Health, Portland State University<br />Jost Lottes, Research Associate, Institute on Aging, Portland State University<br />Dawn Richardson, Assistant Professor of Community Health, Portland State University</p><p>Digital badges, much like embroidered scouting badges, signify an earner’s skills. In higher education educators are using badges to certify student achievements. Badges communicate to students, faculty, and the public what skills students earn during their course of study much better than can a letter grade, certificate, or diploma.</p><p>This session will begin with a theoretical background informing badging including: gamification, motivation, neoliberalization of education, technological innovation, and competency-based curriculum. Next we will discuss how our team--three Community Health professors and one librarian from Portland State University--embedded badges for information literacy into three undergraduate Community Health courses during Fall 2014. Finally, we will present what we learned from the experience. By discussing our learning outcomes-based approach to instructional design, “how tos” of implementing badge technology, and discussing lessons learned, session attendees will discover ways to approach and implement badges at their home institutions.</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.slideshare.net/forder/badges-a-tool-for-embedded-library-instruction">Presentation slides</a></li></ul><h2><span style="font-size:13px">Digitally Inclusive Communities: A Discussion from a Variety of Community Perspectives (rm 115)</span></h2><p>Drew Pizzolato, Digital Literacy Project Coordinator, Literacy, Language and Technology Research Group, Portland State University<br />Kimberly Pendell, Social Work &amp; Social Sciences Librarian, Portland State University<br />Cindy Gibbon, Access &amp; Information Services Director, Multnomah County Library<br />Cece Hughley Noel, Executive Director, Portland Community Media<br />Colleen Dixon, Director of Public Services, Free Geek</p><p>How do communities define and work toward digital inclusion? The possible expansion of Google Fiber into Portland and surrounding cities has spurred conversation among local government, libraries, community-based organizations, and scholars about digital inclusion, and how we can facilitate it in our communities. Panelists representing a variety of perspectives from the Digital Inclusion Network will provide insights from their unique contexts. Attendees will learn about digital inclusion and how it is supported by these organizations.</p><h3><strong>Session Two (11:05 - 11:50)</strong></h3><h2><span style="font-size:13px">The Library as Publisher? Publishing at Portland State University and Oregon State University (rm 111)</span></h2><p>Karen Bjork, Digital Initiatives Coordinator, Portland State University<br />Sue Kunda, Digital Scholarship Librarian, Oregon State University Libraries and Press</p><p>The traditional role of libraries as aggregators, curators and disseminators of resources has been profoundly challenged by the notion of libraries as publishers of content. The traditional publishing model is based on ownership, commerce, paid exchanges, and scholarship as a commodity. Libraries are based on a service model of sharing resources &amp; free exchange. Academic libraries are therefore uniquely positioned to provide publishing solutions which can reduce student costs and provide faculty and students an alternative to traditional publishing. Both Portland State University (PSU) Library and Oregon State University Libraries and Press (OSULP) are providing a variety of publishing solutions to their respective campuses. Attendees will learn about an array of library publishing projects, including PSU’s reTHINK PDX Open Textbook project (part of the Provost’s Challenge), OSULP’s Open Textbook Initiative, publication of conference proceedings and journals (including student-run journals), a student iBook Author project, and several other unique library-campus collaborations. Challenges and opportunities for Library publishing will be discussed, and existing Library publishing models will be examined.</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="http://works.bepress.com/karen_bjork/6/">Presentation slides</a></li></ul><h2><span style="font-size:13px">The Digitally Embedded Librarian: Social Media and Library Instruction (rm 114)</span></h2><p>Elizabeth Brookbank, Instruction Librarian, Western Oregon University</p><p>Students are constantly connected to social networks. Instead of fighting to keep these potential distractions out of the classroom, a professor and a librarian at Western Oregon University embraced them, harnessing their power to increase student engagement. The result? Student collaboration and participation skyrocketed, and information literacy instruction was more meaningfully integrated. Find out how intentional use of social media could help you sustainably expand your reach into the classroom beyond the one-shot instruction session.</p><h2><span style="font-size:13px">Digital Asset Management System Assessment: Use Cases for Digital Infrastructure Re-design (rm 115)</span></h2><p>Steve Van Tuyl, Data and Digital Repository Librarian, Oregon State University Libraries and Press<br />Hui Zhang, Digital Applications Librarian, Oregon State University Libraries and Press<br />Amanda Whitmire, Data Management Specialist, Oregon State University Libraries and Press</p><p>Academic libraries that offer digital asset management systems (DAMS) and services such as an institutional repository, data curation services, and digitization of historic documents face the need to assess and refine services. This need can be most apparent when considering changes to DAMS infrastructure. The proposed panel presents the experiences of OSU Libraries and Press as we move to a new DAMS system for ScholarsArchive@OSU. Before considering DAMS platforms, we conducted an in-depth requirements analysis with our stakeholders, both within our organization as well as with stakeholders outside of the organization. The panelists will include OSU faculty and administrators selected for requirements interviews who present unique use cases for the DAMS, including those for whom the current iteration of the DAMS does not provide adequate service. Audience members will learn about using requirements analysis to design new digital infrastructures and will learn about popular digital library technologies (e.g. Hydra, DSpace).</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/handle/1957/55267">Presentation slides</a></li></ul><h2><span style="font-size:13px">Leveling Up with Citations (ballroom)</span></h2><p>Amy Coughenour, Distance Education &amp; Reference Librarian, Concordia University &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Learning citation and style guidelines can be difficult for many students. For most of them, it’s just plain boring! Quest-based learning, a type of gamified instruction, is one tool to both increase students’ interest and provide instant feedback regarding their progress. As students level up through different quests, they apply the skills they’ve learned while earning experience points, badges, achievements, and rewards. And by using Open Badges, students can display their badges anywhere online: Facebook, LinkedIn, a campus learning management system, online resume, etc. The badges also communicate competency levels to other faculty and instructors. While the examples will come from the 3D Game Lab platform, the concepts and strategies are applicable to other content management systems, such as Google Forms, LibGuides, and learning management systems.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="http://prezi.com/-yrbx_znspxl/?utm_campaign=share&amp;utm_medium=copy">Presentation slides</a></li></ul><h3><strong>Session Three (1:15 - 2:00)</strong></h3><h2><span style="font-size:13px">Wearable Tech is the Future (or WTF?!) (ballroom)</span></h2><p>Laurie Bridges, Instruction and Emerging Technologies Librarian, Oregon State University<br />Korey Jackson, Gray Family Chair for Innovative Library Services, Oregon State University</p><p>Smart watches, Google Glass, and other wearable tech—WTF do they have to do with libraries?! Join us for an overview of wearable tech’s history, current market, and potential future. We'll discuss library related topics such as: privacy concerns, collecting user data, wearable lending, and app development. And finally, of course, we'll talk about the latest and greatest wearable tech gadgets!</p><h2><span style="font-size:13px">Using Digital Objects to Create a Virtual Visit to the Archives (rm 111)</span></h2><p>Maura Valentino, Metadata Librarian, Oregon State University</p><p>While there is extensive literature on creating digital libraries, there is a dearth of literature on encouraging the use of digital libraries. This presentation will discuss a multi-year project to encourage professors to use digital objects as primary source materials in their curriculum. Participants will gain insight into using digital objects as part of learning outcomes and librarian colleagues can determine if introducing digital objects to their users is a valid way to provide service.</p><h2><span style="font-size:13px">Website as Classroom: Content Strategy for Libraries (rm 114)</span></h2><p>Laura Krier, Web Services Librarian, Sonoma State University</p><p>Does your website sometimes seem like a dumping ground for information that no one really reads? Do you wonder how to tie your website to your library’s mission and goals? A good content strategy can be a powerful tool to help you create a purpose-driven, useful, and engaging website, but most books and articles about content strategy are focused on the business world. This presentation will translate the business-speak of content strategy guidelines into a practice that works for libraries. A good content strategy can help you create a website attuned to your library’s goals, that helps you teach your students to find and use information effectively.</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SDMM3_QUGI8oLZUs640EPTf0hdV1VgUssHnsMA9NDKs/edit?usp=sharing">Presentation slides</a></li></ul><h2><span style="font-size:13px">DEVELOPING NOVEL DATA SERVICES: DATA VISUALIZATION AS AN OUTREACH TOOL (rm 115)</span></h2><p>Jackie Wirz, Director of Professional Development and Graduate Student Affairs, Assistant Professor and Biomedical Research Specialist, Oregon Health &amp; Science University</p><p>Although the need for data services at academic institutions is well known, researchers often view data management plans mandates as “sticks.” While working with researchers at Oregon Health &amp; Science University, I have found that Data Visualization is an excellent “carrot”, becoming a tool that fosters discussion, engagement and collaboration. This session will cover how OHSU developed Data Visualization workshops, services, and formal curricula. These data services have led to new partnerships and stronger ties, benefiting both our data management services and our broader library initiatives.</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.slideshare.net/wirzj/online-nw-2015-wirz-data-visualization">Presentation slides</a></li></ul><h3><strong>Session Four (2:10 - 2:55)</strong></h3><h2><span style="font-size:13px">Visualization Tools for Analyzing Bibliographic Citations, Social Media, and Other Large Datasets (rm 115)</span></h2><p>Carolyn Cramer, Research Intelligence Analyst, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory<br />Barbara Wetzel, Research Librarian, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</p><p>Visual analytic tools take advantage of our natural abilities to discover and explore patterns, outliers, trends, and relationships in a structured dataset. We will demonstrate the use of these tools to look at bibliographic citations downloaded from scientific databases, social media content, and other large volume datasets. These tools have unique capabilities with many applications including information and intellectual analysis, strategic planning, and scientific research to help understand the big picture and to formulate questions.</p><h2><span style="font-size:13px">IT for All! Bringing Online Computer Classes Statewide (rm 114)</span></h2><p>Elizabeth Iaukea, Microsoft IT Academy Project Manager, Washington State Library</p><p>More than 50% of today’s jobs require some technology skills, and experts expect that percentage will increase to 77% in the next decade. Through online courses, The Microsoft IT Academy (ITA) provides industry-leading technology skills to help bridge the skills gap. In partnership with Microsoft, the Washington State Library has provided the Microsoft ITA to state residents through local community and technical college, public, and tribal libraries. In addition to online courses and other digital self-study resources, the second year of their deployment saw a push to increase supply and demand for Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS) certifications statewide. Project Managers from both sides of the aisle – vendor and customer share information about what the program consists of, how it can be deployed, and lessons learned and best practices for states or communities considering jumping on the Microsoft ITA bandwagon to bring IT training to local communities.</p><h2><span style="font-size:13px">Using Topic Modeling to Enhance Access to Digital Government and Archival Collections (rm 111)</span></h2><p>Jonathan Cain, Government Information Librarian, University of Oregon<br />Kira Homo, Electronic Records Archivist, University of Oregon</p><p>Providing access to digital collections can be problematic, librarians and archivists are inundated with poorly described born-digital materials with scant metadata. Topic modeling, a method of statistical analysis that can discover thematic elements within a set of documents, allows archivists and librarians working with digital collections to describe and make accessible digital material without laborious manual processing.Our presentation will show how libraries can easily implement topic modeling in diverse library environments dealing with digital texts.</p><h2><span style="font-size:13px">Web Literacy: Using &amp; Sharing Dynamic Tools to Learn &amp; Teach The Web [Workshop] (ballroom)</span></h2><p>Tim Miller, General Reference and Instruction Librarian, Humboldt State University</p><p>Web literacy - the ability to build, connect and explore web components - is quickly becoming inextricably linked to information literacy. Experiential learning is essential in teaching the future of information discovery. In this workshop, we will review useful Open Educational Resources and use code playgrounds to create customized search widgets using HTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript. We will then briefly examine how to apply these concepts to develop other tools, including plugins and browser extensions.</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/weblit-onw15">Presentation slides </a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://sometimesmotion.net/queryString.html">Creating customized search boxes using HTML &amp; JavaScript &nbsp;</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/weblit-tools-onw15">A list of tutorials, applications and software to learn and teach the Web </a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://libguides.humboldt.edu/webdev">Humboldt State University Library's LibGuide about teaching how to create for the Web</a></li></ul><h2>Lightning Talks</h2><p>Tina Ching, Seattle University School of Law &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Rotting to the Core: How the Internet is Degrading the Law</p><p>Natalia Fernández, Oregon State University &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Using PressBooks to Engage Students with Campus History</p><p>J.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>2017 Conference Presentations</h1><p>We've got a great program for you this year! The following are the confirmed presentations for the upcoming 2017 Online Northwest Conference.&nbsp;</p><h2>full schedule</h2><p><strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0unLCRabdoyTDVGeGFTX0k0Z1U/view?usp=sharing">Online Northwest 2017 Program (pdf)</a></strong></p><h2>Schedule AT a glance</h2><p>8:30 - 9:00:&nbsp;Continental Breakfast, Welcome Table, On-site Registration,&nbsp;Hoffman Hall</p><p>9:00 - 10:00:&nbsp;Keynote: Social Justice in LIS: Finding the Imperative to Act, Dr. Safiya Umoja Noble,&nbsp;Hoffman Hall</p><p>10:00 - 10:15: Break</p><p>10:15 - 11:00: Session One, presentation room&nbsp;</p><p>11:00 - 11:15: Break</p><p>11:15 - 12:00: Session Two, presentation rooms</p><p>12:00 - 1:15: Lunch, Hoffman Hall&nbsp;</p><p>1:15 - 2:00: Session Three, room locations</p><p>2:00 - 2:15: Break</p><p>2:15 - 3:00: Session Four,&nbsp;presentation rooms</p><p>3:00 - 3:20: Light Refreshments, Hoffman Hall</p><p>3:20 - 4:00: Lightning Talks, Hoffman Hall</p><h2><em>User Experience/Understanding Users </em></h2><p><a target="_blank" href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/onlinenorthwest/2017/schedule/1/"><strong>When It Breaks: Minimizing and Mitigating System and User Errors in eResources</strong>&nbsp;</a></p><p>Jill Locascio,&nbsp;SUNY College of Optometry</p><p style="margin-left:40px">System and user errors are an inevitable part of using libraries' online resources. Encountering these errors as well as any accompanying error messages lead to significant pain points in user experience. This presentation will describe libraries can combat these pain points by conducting a tandem availability-usability study to identify common system and user errors and develop various work-arounds ranging from tool tips to error page customization (where possible) to ameliorate the frustration involved with encountering these errors.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/onlinenorthwest/2017/schedule/5/"><strong>Help the Library Receive Candy: The ILL Usability Project at Reed College </strong></a></p><p>Eric Alwine &amp; Annie Downey, Reed College</p><p style="margin-left:40px">This session examines the methods and results of a usability project assessing the Reed College Library’s interlibrary loan (ILL) program. Employing a service design approach (including “guerrilla”-style web usability studies, user surveys, and student worker interviews), the Reed Library User Experience (LUX) team worked closely with library users and staff to understand the various processes that make up the ILL user experience. Though this session will focus on Reed’s ILL usability project as its example, it will be especially concerned with exploring tools and methods that could be used to conduct similar projects at other institutions.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/onlinenorthwest/2017/schedule/13/"><strong>Assessing and Addressing Patrons’ Digital Problem Solving Skills: What Does Digital Equity Look Like in the the Library?&nbsp;</strong></a></p><p>Cindy Gibbon &amp; Judy Anderson, Multnomah County Library &amp; Jill Castek, University of Arizona</p><p style="margin-left:40px">Data from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) shows that adults in the US are less skilled in digital problem solving than in many other countries. How does that translate to our patrons, and what does it mean for how we provide services? We used a digital problem solving assessment tool to find out if our patrons’ skills matched up with national data, and we mapped the digital skills we assessed to common library tasks. Results will help us take action to inform our training efforts, our digital presence, and how we advocate for our patrons.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/onlinenorthwest/2017/schedule/9/"><strong>When to Teach It and When to Trash It: Library Terminology, Instruction, and Content Strategy</strong></a></p><p>Adrienne Alger,&nbsp;University of Montana</p><p style="margin-left:40px">When should jargon be trashed and when should it be taught? We conducted an undergraduate survey of library terminology on our library’s website. Terms with less than 60% comprehension were brought to a committee of instruction librarians to determine which jargon is worth eradicating and which is worth saving for the sake of research and information literacy instruction. Saved jargon will be worked into the library website’s new content strategy, editorial standards, library guides, and instruction guidelines, so that librarians can make important terminology more meaningful and less confusing to students.</p><hr /><h2><em>DESIGN</em></h2><p><a target="_blank" href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/onlinenorthwest/2017/schedule/2/"><strong>Mind the Gap: Research Instruction in Online vs. Face-to-Face Courses</strong></a></p><p>Elizabeth Pickard, Portland State University</p><p style="margin-left:40px">A 2016 Pew study showed people increasingly rely on libraries to help determine what information is authoritative, so what happens to students’ research when they do not encounter a librarian at all? Many online-only courses pose this scenario. The presenter is currently working with anthropology faculty on a study that suggests online-only students use less authoritative sources. The study also explores ways to address this divide. This session will present some early findings of the study and look across existing research to address the questions: Who is currently teaching research skills to online-only students? How do online-only students encounter the library, and how does it compare to the experience of students in face-to-face courses? What are some strategies for connecting students in online courses to research skills instruction?</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/onlinenorthwest/2017/schedule/6/"><strong>The Design of Library Things: Creating a Cohesive Brand Identity for Your Library</strong></a></p><p>Stacy Taylor &amp; Maureen Rust, Central Washington University</p><p style="margin-left:40px">Establishing a cohesive visual look for your library improves recognition, engagement, and trust among your community. But presenting a unified appearance can be a challenge when there are a wide variety of faculty and staff members creating promotional and marketing materials. In this session we’ll explore the challenges faced and lessons learned as the Brooks Library developed, revised, and ultimately implemented a library-wide brand identity to establish standards and best practices for the design and tone of the library’s print and digital content. Attendees will receive access to our approved Brand Identity, including helpful resources used.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/onlinenorthwest/2017/schedule/10/"><strong>Is Your Research Valid?: Reflections on the Institute for Research Design in Librarianship</strong></a></p><p>Jonathan Cain &amp; Tatiana Bryant, University of Oregon</p><p style="margin-left:40px">This session will talk about two librarians experience in attending the Institute on Research Design in Libraries. The presenters will give an overview of the program (its history and focus), will discuss research methods in library research. There will be a focus on qualitative research methods. There will be a brief hands on exercise on qualitative data analysis.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/onlinenorthwest/2017/schedule/14/"><strong>Best Practices in Information Literacy Videos</strong></a></p><p>Sami Kerzel, Oregon State University - Cascades Campus</p><p style="margin-left:40px">Online. Hybrid. Flipped. Blended. Active. According to The Chronicle of Education, 28% of college students take an online course, and 63% of colleges find online courses important long-term. Where does information literacy fit in this changing landscape? This presentation will review information literacy instruction practices, and outline best practices based on an analysis of information literacy videos, including user engagement data and length, to help achieve heightened viewer engagement. A group discussion and expanded list of best practices will conclude the presentation. No matter the type of library these best practices will be applicable to any online tutorial.</p><hr /><h2>ENGAGEMENT/IMPACT</h2><p><a target="_blank" href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/onlinenorthwest/2017/schedule/3/"><strong>The (Non) Use of Repositories: A Case Study</strong></a></p><p>Kimberly Pendell, Portland State University</p><p style="margin-left:40px">Research is key for professionals in fields such as social work to improve practice; however, most articles are unavailable outside the academic sphere, locked behind expensive paywalls. Repositories could help overcome this barrier, but are authors depositing their work? This presentation presents the results of examining over 600 citations from high impact social work journals for access via repositories and other platforms. Due to the recentness of data collection, the study also documents authors’ use of the ResearchGate platform to share research. The presentation will prompt discussion regarding repositories, discoverability outside of the academy, and copyright awareness among faculty.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/onlinenorthwest/2017/schedule/7/"><strong>Bridging the Digital Divide: the Tech Connect Model</strong></a></p><p>Amy Payne,&nbsp;Klamath County Library Service District</p><p style="margin-left:40px">This presentation will discuss Tech Connect, a monthly “book club for computers” held by the Klamath County Public Library. Library staff demonstrate various online tools and sites, and patrons can get hands-on experience in a supportive environment. The digital divide is alive and well in southern Oregon: many Klamath County patrons do not own their own computers and are reliant on the library to connect to the internet at all. Because of this, they lack experience using these tools. Tech Connect helps them become more confident in their skills, making them more independent computer users.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/onlinenorthwest/2017/schedule/11/"><strong>Academic-Public Libraries Partnerships: Providing Technology Workshops for the Central Valley Community</strong></a></p><p>Raymond Pun, California State University, Fresno</p><p style="margin-left:40px">This session explores how the academic library collaborates with the public to provide new services and support to the community at large. The academic library created a grant proposal focusing on bridging the digital divide in the Central Valley. Librarians trained and selected student ambassadors to visit different library branches and teach various technology workshops in fall 2016-spring 2017. The presentation explores the challenges and opportunities of creating this collaborative program and emphasizes the importance of such partnerships between public and academic libraries. Attendees will also gain ideas on best practices in creating collaborative programs with public/academic library partners.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/onlinenorthwest/2017/schedule/15/"><strong>Reducing Textbook Cost with Current Library E-book Holdings</strong></a></p><p>Maura Valentino, Oregon State University</p><p style="margin-left:40px">The high cost of textbooks interferes with student success. Last fall, librarian Maura Valentino began a program to compare the list of required textbooks across the university to the library’s holdings of e-books with unlimited license. This allows each student in a given class to access the textbook for free, from anywhere, at any time. To date, this program has saved students $830,000 and that figure grows each quarter. This presentation will review the number of books found and purchased, the amount saved and the workflow that can be used to create a similar program at other institutions.</p><hr /><h2><em>Working with Data</em></h2><p><a target="_blank" href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/onlinenorthwest/2017/schedule/4/"><strong>Ostriches, Minotaurs, Ghosts and Fossils in the Brave New Metadata World</strong></a></p><p>Kelley McGrath, University of Oregon</p><p style="margin-left:40px">Linked data promises to make library metadata more accessible and powerful. The clearly-defined URIs will form chains that lead to new connections and insights. But is there a flip side to such sharply-delineated data? Real life is messy and natural language doesn’t come with precise definitions. What happens in an environment that seems to require black-and white conclusions? What are the implications for the usefulness of linked data? This presentation will look at some challenges for bibliographic metadata in a linked data environment and discuss some possible approaches to handling them.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/onlinenorthwest/2017/schedule/8/"><strong>Using OpenRefine to Standardize and Augment Your Data</strong></a></p><p>Blake Galbreath, Washington State University</p><p style="margin-left:40px">As librarians, we work with an ever-increasing amount of data and metadata. However, these data are often messy, disorganized, and seemingly disparate from other caches of data. Free tools such as OpenRefine allow us to clean, organize, and connect data sets to one another – all without knowing how to write complicated code. In this presentation, I will demonstrate the refining I have undertaken to create better and more usable data sets.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/onlinenorthwest/2017/schedule/16/"><strong>Creating a System for the Online Delivery of Oral History Content</strong></a></p><p>Chris Petersen, Oregon State University</p><p style="margin-left:40px">Over the past four years, faculty and staff in the OSU Libraries have created the largest oral history collection ever gathered at Oregon State University. This same group of archivists, programmers, and students have created a platform for the delivery of contextualized video- and audio-recorded oral history interviews, complete with transcripts delivered as web text and PDF, as well as contextual information (biographical sketches, abstracts) for each interview. Interviews are also tagged according to interviewee affiliation or theme, and can be sorted as such. This talk will discuss the platform that the OSU Libraries created to present this information online. The platform relies upon description of digital objects using the METS, MODS, and TEI metadata standards, as well as custom XSL stylesheets that batch generate HTML for eventual upload to the web.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/onlinenorthwest/2017/schedule/12/"><strong>Open Oregon Resources: From Google Form to Interactive Web Apps</strong></a></p><p>Amy Hofer,&nbsp;Linn-Benton Community College &amp; Tamara Marnell,&nbsp;Central Oregon Community College</p><p style="margin-left:40px">The Open Oregon Resource page is a unique list of known OER adoptions at Oregon's community colleges. It provides a peer endorsement for faculty who want to know which open, free, or low-cost materials their colleagues at other colleges are using in their courses. With approximately 200 entries, this list represents tremendous progress on textbook affordability across the state. In this session, the Open Oregon coordinator and web developer will demonstrate how they used the Sheets API to output the results of a Google Form into a searchable table on a WordPress website. The same data powers the interactive Z-Degree graphic that shows how close we are to a fully OER transfer degree pathway, both statewide and at each community college. These two projects provide powerful tools to represent the impact of the OER movement at Oregon's community colleges.</p><hr /><h2>Lightning Talks</h2><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/onlinenorthwest/2017/schedule/17/"><strong>Use Analytics to Put Your Social Media on Cruise Control</strong></a>, Adele Larson, Portland State University</li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/onlinenorthwest/2017/schedule/18/"><strong>240,000 Items Validated in 10 Weeks at 40 Libraries: Google App Script to the Rescue!</strong></a>, Sara Amato, Eastern Academic Scholar's Trust</li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/onlinenorthwest/2017/schedule/19/"><strong>Electronic Marginalia</strong></a>, Lorena O'English, Washington State University</li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/onlinenorthwest/2017/schedule/20/"><strong>Designing Digital Literacy Programming for Transformative Social Engagement</strong></a>, Tim Miller, Humboldt State University</li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/onlinenorthwest/2017/schedule/21/"><strong>The Lab: Hip Hop and Library Technology</strong></a>, Craig Arthur, Virginia Tech &amp; Max Macias, Portland Community College</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>
