* Two presenters from each session (excluding lightning-talkers) pay a discounted registration cost. 

* Most of the attendees are librarians from the academic community, but we are seeing increasing attendance from public, special, and school libraries, as well as others from the information industry. Your presentation should be directed at the moderate to experienced user. Emphasize the practical.

* Programs are forty-five minutes in length. Please structure your program so that there is at least 5 minutes at the end for questions. Past conference attendees have commented that this is often the richest part of the program for them. Members of the conference committee will be on hand to provide time cues.

* Attendees may spend the first few minutes of the session "shopping around" for a program; expect to see several people arriving up to five minutes into your program, but don't feel that you have to back up in your program and bring them up to speed â€” they'll catch up.

* You are strongly encouraged to make any handouts, Powerpoint presentations, and supplementary materials available via a web site, and to send the URL to the conference committee after the conference is over. The conference committee will post the link from the PSU conference website to your presentation materials following the conference.

* Each conference room will be equipped with a laptop PC, LCD video projector, and Internet access. If you have further audiovisual needs, [please contact us](/about).

* If you use Powerpoint, test your presentation on more than one computer, as well as with the Powerpoint viewer, before you leave for the conference.

* The conference committee makes every effort to accommodate conference participants and presenters with special needs. If, as a presenter, you receive a request from someone with special needs, we encourage you to accommodate them as much as possible. If you have a request for accommodation request yourself, [please contact us](/about).
